            <h2 class="bio">Why Gamedev</h2>
            <h3 class="bio">Growing up playing videogames, my imagination was always running wild with ideas
                for games that I could make 'when I knew how to code'.
            </h3>
            <h3 class="bio">Fas forward a couple of years, and I was introduced to this free open-source
                engine called 'Godot' by a game-jam youtube video. After learning the very basics of the
                 interface, I began writing my own versions of games that I used to play on school chromebooks
                 like 'Wings.io'.
            </h3>
            <h3 class="bio">In november of 2024, I began working on 'Shroom Slaughter', a rogue-like wave-based
                game where you fend off hordes of enemies and upgrade your stats between rounds. I look forward to
                building even larger games in the future.
